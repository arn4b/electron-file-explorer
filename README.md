# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Electron JS File Explorer

This is a basic File explorer made using ElectronJS to interact with the Operating System, ReactJS to give life to components and enable Navigation and Smooth UX and Bootstrap to give character to the design and UI.

Note that this file explorer is not able to open the files of any extendion, but is only able to navigate through directories, show the content of the folders, and the size of the files in it.
